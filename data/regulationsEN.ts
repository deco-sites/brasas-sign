    `BRASAS IN-PERSON REGULATIONS – Methods | September 2025 – 2nd Semester

METHODS AND MATERIALS
BRASAS, originally created as a closed course for executives and postgraduate scholarship holders abroad, has always aimed at efficient and fast English teaching. We have developed our own method and materials (created by George P. Zinovetz), which are periodically reviewed.
English is used exclusively from the first day of class. Our material was developed based on the linguistic differences between Portuguese and English, addressing the specific difficulties of Brazilian students.
The teaching material is exclusive, created by BRASAS, and specific to each age group. It also undergoes frequent pedagogical review and constant updating. Every year, new teachers go through our Training Program (5 hours a day for one month). BRASAS maintains strict quality control of its teachers, with constant supervision by the academic coordination and the systematic implementation of professional development programs such as workshops and seminars.
Our classes are dynamic and relaxed, always emphasizing structured conversation. Grammar is taught naturally—not as an end in itself, but as a communicative element—so that students speak appropriately and correctly. We use a variety of activities and explore everyday situations.
We offer courses for children, teens, and adults, with materials and techniques appropriate for each age group.

INSIDE THE CLASSROOM
● REPETITION: Articulation drills and fixation of basic structures, pronunciation, and intonation.
● SUBSTITUTION: The link between repetition and the conscious communication process.
● QUESTIONS: About material already assimilated through repetition, substitution, or reading.
● DIALOGUES: Simple and creative, expanding the repertoire of expressions commonly used in everyday life.
● CORRECTIONS: All corrections are made orally, with repetition and explanation.
● CONVERSATION: Oral development forcing reasoning in English. Free conversation is used only when the student masters linguistic structures, to avoid reinforcing language habits.
● PRONUNCIATION AND INTONATION: The teacher uses normal pronunciation, rhythm, intonation, and speed—not “classroom English.”
● VIDEO: Used to enrich learning and contact with the English language.
● INTERACTIVE DEVICE: Interactive device (electronic board or smart TV) used by the teacher in the classroom to dynamically teach content.

WHAT STUDENTS CAN DO ON THEIR OWN IS NOT DONE IN CLASS
Classroom: 50% | Audio: 25% | Homework: 25%

OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM
What students are expected to do to complement in-class learning:

1
● Visual organization of material already presented orally in class.
● Grammar rules for comparative study. Texts to be read at home and discussed in class.
● List of new words with their definitions and examples (in English).
● Related groups of ideas or objects.
● Outline of the presented material. Written exercises.
● Programs and videos with English subtitles.
● Grammar: At BRASAS, we teach English grammar naturally in class (always spoken and without the use of translation), as a native speaker would learn it. Only after this initial oral teaching phase do we direct students to reinforce the grammatical point studied using our teaching material. Grammar exercises are done not only in the BRASAS book but also in Cambridge University Press grammar books, which serve as a pedagogical complement to reinforce grammatical structures learned in class.

Cambridge basic grammar is adopted in the Juvenile course starting from book J1B and in the regular Adult course in books 3, 4, and 5. In books 6, 7, 8, and 9, we adopt Cambridge intermediate grammar. In the Seniors course (for students aged 60 or older), we use the same grammar book scheme adopted in the regular Adult course.
Our students study using the American version of Cambridge grammar books so that their content aligns with what is taught during BRASAS classes.

● BRASAS AUDIO TRACKS: Audio materials are an integral part of our method, enabling:
● Individualized learning.
● Development of listening comprehension, eliminating the habit of understanding only the teacher and training the ear to recognize variations and regional accents.
● Improvement of pronunciation and intonation through individual repetition at increasing speeds, with natural contractions and omissions of the language.
● Repetition of certain sections as many times as necessary.

The audio materials were recorded by native English speakers from various countries and regions, speaking at the natural rhythm of the language and portraying everyday situations.
Listening to the audios whenever possible is recommended to increase fluency, self-confidence, and overall performance. The audios are now available on major music apps. Search for BRASAS ENGLISH COURSE on your favorite player and happy studying!

LISTEN TO EACH LESSON’S AUDIOS AT LEAST 3 TIMES.

OPENING AND REASSIGNMENT
New groups may be opened at any time of the year when enrollment reaches the minimum number required for educational and economic viability.
The minimum is 10 students per group. While enrollment remains above 10, BRASAS will maintain the group at its original schedule. Below this number, reassignment to other groups at the same unit may be considered.
If the initial commitment is broken by students due to withdrawal, dropout, transfers, level changes, etc., they will be reassigned to other groups and schedules at the same or another unit, according to BRASAS availability. If the new group is slightly ahead, extra classes will be offered at no cost so the student can catch up.
If reassignment requires repeating lessons, credit will be applied to the payment corresponding to the difference. If the student chooses not to transfer, including rejecting the offered credit, they must request cancellation in writing.
Students enrolled in promotional groups are entitled to the discount only if they remain in promotional groups. If a student changes groups for any reason, they will no longer be entitled to the promotional discount, which applies only to specific groups/schedules at the school’s discretion.
THE OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE GROUPS IS MUTUAL.

ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES

    `BRASAS POLICY - PORTUGUESE FOR FOREIGNERS :  ONLINE CLASSES | September 2025  
BRASAS METHOD – PORTUGUESE FOR FOREIGNERS 
The Portuguese for Foreigners course was created in 2014 and has always aimed at efficient and 
rapid teaching of Brazilian Portuguese, using the BRASAS methodology developed by George P. 
Zinovetz and the materials written by Eleonora Zinovetz. 
Portuguese is used exclusively from the first day of class. All new teachers undergo our Training 
Program, where they learn to apply our methodology. BRASAS maintains strict quality control of 
its teachers, with constant supervision from the pedagogical coordination team and systematic 
training through workshops and seminars. 
Our classes are dynamic and relaxed, always emphasizing structured conversation. Grammar is 
taught naturally, not as an end in itself, but as a communicative element, ensuring that students 
speak appropriately and correctly. We use a wide variety of activities and explore everyday 
situations. 
BRASAS MATERIAL 
All teaching materials are exclusive, created by BRASAS, and undergo frequent pedagogical 
review and constant updates. The books and support materials will be available on a platform 
accessed through a username and password, valid only during the course. Access does not 
permit reproduction of the content by printing or exporting in any format (such as PDF or Word), 
nor does it allow access after the course ends. 
The teaching material adopted by BRASAS is essential for students to follow classes adequately 
and is protected under Copyright Law No. 9.610/98. 
BRASAS ONLINE

    `BRASAS POLICY - PORTUGUESE FOR FOREIGNERS :  IN PERSON CLASSES | September 2025  
BRASAS METHOD – PORTUGUESE FOR FOREIGNERS 
The Portuguese for Foreigners course was created in 2014 and has always aimed at efficient and 
rapid teaching of Brazilian Portuguese, using the BRASAS methodology developed by George P. 
Zinovetz and the materials written by Eleonora Zinovetz. 
Portuguese is used exclusively from the first day of class. All new teachers undergo our Training 
Program, where they learn to apply our methodology. BRASAS maintains strict quality control of 
its teachers, with constant supervision from the pedagogical coordination team and systematic 
training through workshops and seminars. 
Our classes are dynamic and relaxed, always emphasizing structured conversation. Grammar is 
taught naturally, not as an end in itself, but as a communicative element, ensuring that students 
speak appropriately and correctly. We use a wide variety of activities and explore everyday 
situations. 
BRASAS MATERIAL 
All teaching materials are exclusive, created by BRASAS, and undergo frequent pedagogical 
review and constant updates. BRASAS provides e-books and print books. 
The teaching material adopted by BRASAS is essential for students to follow classes adequately 
and is protected under Copyright Law No. 9.610/98. 
● Digital books - The books and support materials will be available on a platform accessed 
through a username and password, valid only during the course. Access does not permit 
reproduction of the content by printing or exporting in any format (such as PDF or Word), nor
