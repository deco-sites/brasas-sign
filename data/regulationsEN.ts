BRASAS IN-PERSON REGULATIONS – Methods | February 2024 – 1st Semester
METHODS AND MATERIALS
BRASAS, originally created as a closed course for executives and graduate scholarship students abroad, has always aimed at efficient and fast English learning. We have developed our own method and materials (created by George P. Zinovetz), which are periodically revised.
English is used exclusively from the very first day of class. Our material was developed based on the linguistic differences between Portuguese and English, addressing the specific difficulties of Brazilian students.
The teaching material is exclusive, created by BRASAS, and tailored for each age group. It also undergoes frequent pedagogical review and constant updates. Every year, new teachers go through our Training Program (5 hours daily for one month). BRASAS maintains strict quality control over its teachers, with constant supervision by the pedagogical coordination team and systematic professional development programs such as workshops and seminars.
Our classes are dynamic and relaxed, always emphasizing structured conversation. Grammar is taught naturally, not as an end goal, but as a communicative tool, so that students speak appropriately and correctly. We use varied activities and explore real-life situations.
We offer courses for children, teenagers, and adults with materials and techniques appropriate for each age group.

INSIDE THE CLASSROOM

REPETITION: Articulation training and reinforcement of basic structures, pronunciation, and intonation.

SUBSTITUTION: The link between repetition and the conscious process of communication.

QUESTIONS: Based on material already assimilated through repetition, substitution, or reading.

DIALOGUES: Simple and creative, expanding the range of commonly used daily expressions.

CORRECTIONS: All corrections are made orally, with repetition and explanation.

CONVERSATION: Oral development encouraging reasoning in English. Free conversation is only used when the student masters the linguistic structures, to avoid reinforcing bad language habits.

PRONUNCIATION AND INTONATION: The teacher uses normal pronunciation, rhythm, intonation, and speed – not “classroom English.”

VIDEO: Used to enrich learning and exposure to the English language.

INTERACTIVE DEVICE: Interactive whiteboard used by the teacher in the classroom to teach content dynamically.

WHAT STUDENTS CAN DO ON THEIR OWN IS NOT DONE IN THE CLASSROOM
Classroom: 50% | Audio: 25% | Homework: 25%

OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM
What students are expected to do to complement their classroom learning:

Visual organization of material already presented orally in class.

Grammar rules for comparative study. Texts to be read at home, with comprehension later discussed in class.

List of new words with their definitions and examples (in English).

Related groups of ideas or objects.

1

Outline of the material presented. Written exercises.

Programs and videos with English subtitles.

Grammar: At BRASAS we teach English grammar naturally in class (always spoken and without the use of translation), just as a native speaker would learn. Only after this initial stage of oral teaching of grammatical structures in class do we guide students to reinforce the study of the grammar point learned with our teaching material. Grammar exercises are done not only in BRASAS books but also in Cambridge University Press grammar books, which serve as a pedagogical complement to consolidate the grammatical structures learned in class.
The Cambridge basic-level grammar is adopted in the Junior course, starting from book J1B, and in the Regular Adult course, in books 3, 4, and 5. In books 6, 7, 8, and 9 we adopt Cambridge’s intermediate grammar. In the Seniors course (for students aged 60 and above), we use the same grammar book scheme as in the Regular Adult course.
Our students study with the American edition of Cambridge grammar books so that the content coincides with what we teach in BRASAS classes.

BRASAS AUDIO TRACKS: The audio recordings are an integral part of our method, enabling:

Individualized learning.

Development of listening comprehension, eliminating the habit of only understanding the teacher, training the ear to recognize variations and regional accents.

Improvement of pronunciation and intonation through individual repetition, at increasing speeds, with contractions and natural omissions of the language.

Repetition of certain passages as many times as necessary.

The audios were recorded by native English speakers from several countries and regions, speaking at the natural rhythm of the language and covering everyday situations.
It is recommended to listen to the audios as often as possible to increase fluency, self-confidence, and speaking ability. The audios are now available on major music apps. Search for BRASAS ENGLISH COURSE on your favorite player and happy studying!

LISTEN TO EACH LESSON’S AUDIO AT LEAST 3 TIMES.

2

BRASAS’ DUTIES

Monitor each student’s progress individually and, if necessary, place them in a more appropriate level.

Guide students with difficulties by offering completely free support classes, either at the same unit or another BRASAS unit, at times determined by the institution, since learning a foreign language requires certain skills that vary from person to person.

Provide an adequate learning environment.

Prevent behaviors that may harm the rest of the class.

BRASAS will not be held responsible for objects left behind or lost on its premises.

STUDENT DUTIES

Arrive on time for the beginning of class and attend the class in full.

Attention: Recording classes in any format—audio and/or video, either excerpts or the entire class—is strictly prohibited. BRASAS reserves the right to take legal action to preserve its intellectual property and the teacher’s rights.

Complete all homework and listen to the audio tracks.

Speak only in English in the classroom (and, whenever possible, outside the classroom as well).

Speak with the teacher or director if having difficulty keeping up with the class.

Present proof of payment whenever requested. Keep all contact information up to date, such as address, phone number, and email, including in the event of a change in the financial guarantor.

Report to the course office whenever your attendance record is not in the classroom.

Attend on the dates and times scheduled for group evaluations.

Achieve a minimum average grade of 70 in order to pass.*

Submit a written request in case of cancellation (withdrawal) from the module or transfer to another unit or time slot.

Settle any outstanding debts from the period prior to official withdrawal.

For questions and suggestions, visit: brasas.com
Your message will be directed to the Central Office

Remember: Respect your classmates’ rights.

IMPORTANT | Minimum passing grades:

Modules: J4, BOOK 3, BOOK 7, and BOOK 10: 70 in all exams.

Other modules: Average of 70, minimum of 70 in the oral exam, and no grade lower than 60.

CLASS OPENING AND REALLOCATION
New classes may be opened at any time of the year once enrollment reaches the minimum number of students required to make them both pedagogically and economically viable:

The minimum number is 10 students per class. As long as enrollment remains above 10, BRASAS will maintain the class at its original schedule. If it falls below that number, students may be reassigned to other classes within the same unit, if available.

If students break the initial commitment by withdrawing (cancellation), dropping out, transferring, changing levels, etc., they will be reassigned to other classes and schedules, at the same or another unit, according to BRASAS’ availability. If the new class is slightly ahead of the previous one, extra lessons will be provided at no cost to the student to help them reach the same level as the new group.

3

If, due to reassignment, the student has to repeat lessons, a credit will be given toward payment for the difference in lessons. If the student chooses not to transfer to any of the new classes, including rejecting the credit offered, they must request the cancellation of their enrollment in writing.
Students enrolled in promotional classes are only entitled to the discount if they remain in a promotional class. If, for any reason, the student changes classes, they will no longer be entitled to the discount, which is specific to certain classes/schedules freely chosen by the school. In other words, the school is not obliged to open a new promotional class at the same level/schedule to meet the student’s specific needs.

THE OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE CLASSES IS MUTUAL.

ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES

PAYMENTS: Each student pays 12 consecutive monthly fees per year, including holidays, vacations, and recesses. Payment is due regardless of the student’s presence in class. Tuition fees are due on the 10th (tenth) of each month. Payments must be made at any bank by the due date. For security reasons, we do not accept cash payments at our offices. Tuition fees not paid by the due date will incur a 2% (two percent) late fee and 0.033% daily interest on the principal amount. In case of default, after 60 days past the due date, the bill will be automatically submitted to the bank’s negative credit system, along with Serasa and/or SPC. At that point, the student will have 15 days from the date of receiving the Serasa/SPC letter to make payment before being listed as a defaulter. After the 15th day without payment confirmation, the student will be negatively listed. If the bill is paid, the removal of the negative listing will be automatic.

CANCELLATIONS: BRASAS reserves the right to suspend or cancel the enrollment of any student who is in default with payments for educational services. The student may be denied access to the school’s premises from the first day of default until the overdue balance, plus legal and contractual charges, is paid in full, without any right to compensation for the period during which the student was prevented from attending classes.
If the student chooses not to continue the course, it is the responsibility of the student/guardian to notify BRASAS through official communication channels before the next scheduled monthly payment is charged, via email to their unit.

ASSESSMENTS: Tests and evaluations are made available in class for students to check grades and corrections and are later archived at the respective unit to prevent fraud, copying, plagiarism, modifications, or other future issues.

REFUNDS: Payments will only be refunded if, due to internal reasons, BRASAS is unable to start the class in which the student enrolled, provided the student has no interest in transferring to another schedule.

BRASAS BOOK: Books will only be exchanged if defective. We do not refund book payments.

MAKEUP TESTS: Students who miss the final exam of a module due to medical or work-related reasons, and who present a certificate, may take the makeup test free of charge at a date and time set by the unit. In other cases of advancing or postponing any exam, the student must pay according to the fee schedule available at the office.

VACATIONS: Individual vacations will result in reclassification into another class. Collective vacations will be determined by regional units.

COURSE INTERRUPTIONS: To interrupt their course, the student must request enrollment cancellation in writing before the next scheduled monthly payment is charged.

4

The request must be sent to the email of your unit. It is also necessary to complete the form that formalizes the course interruption and to settle any outstanding debts. To return to the course after an interruption of less than 3 months, the student must pay all charges related to the period not attended. Students who have been absent for more than three months must undergo a placement test.

CERTIFICATES:

Basic – issued at the end of BOOK 3.

Advanced | Proficiency – automatically issued at the end of the last level. Only students with a score above 80 in each exam will receive the Proficiency certificate.

ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION: The sending of materials promoting BRASAS services, academic and/or financial newsletters, and any other notices deemed necessary to strengthen communication between the parties is authorized electronically.

Activities in English for students enrolled from Pre-K2 onward.

FREQUENCY:

1 or 2 times per week, with a duration of 2 semesters per segment.

Pre-K: 12 monthly payments per year. Classes are 50 minutes long in all Pre-K segments.

KIDS | JUNIORS & TEENS
Youth courses have the same objectives as our regular course but are less intensive due to students’ age, as they do not yet fully master certain linguistic structures (even in Portuguese).
Our goal is for students to acquire fluency in the structures they know, good pronunciation and intonation, basic vocabulary, and a love for English.

PLACEMENT TEST: For students with some knowledge of English.

FREQUENCY: Always two classes per week. KIDS and JUNIORS classes last 70 minutes, and TEENS classes last 85 minutes.

AGE:

KIDS – school level from 3rd grade of Elementary School. Only literate students are accepted so that English does not interfere with literacy in Portuguese.

JUNIORS – school level from 6th grade of Elementary School.

TEENS – J4 to J10.

CLASS: Structured conversation with a youth-oriented approach (see classroom section). Classes are taught in English, focusing on conversation, using dialogues, educational games, and songs. There is written homework to reinforce grammar and vocabulary.

CERTIFICATES: Students will receive completion certificates.

COURSE DURATION:

KIDS – two levels, one year each. At the end of the course, an individual assessment is carried out considering performance and maturity. Students are promoted to JUNIORS.

JUNIORS – five semester levels, at the end of which students are individually assessed to enter TEENS or the Regular course.

6

VOCABULARY: We ask parents to avoid anxiety and pressure regarding vocabulary. Students will feel frustrated if they do not know the answer to a question (even if they know many other things).

ASSESSMENT: Since our goal is to maximize students’ potential, we suggest that parents communicate with teachers to follow their child’s development. The best assessment is made through classroom participation, creative work, and even games and activities.
Parents who are proficient in English can check their child’s learning by reviewing dialogues done in class. We issue report cards with the following grading scale:

JUNIORS	TEENS	KIDS
Excellent	90–100	E
Very Good	80–89	MB
Good	70–79	B
Attention	Below passing range	A
Insufficient	Below 70	–

LEVEL ADVANCEMENT: Carried out after an individual exam, usually at the end of the semester. Students with excessive absences or learning difficulties may be recommended to repeat the period.

CLASS REALLOCATION: May occur due to level advancement or schedule changes. Seats and schedules must be confirmed after final exam results are released.

PAYMENTS: If a student has unpaid fees, BRASAS may cancel their enrollment if the student has been absent and did not communicate with the course. The student remains responsible for outstanding payments until cancellation.

SCHOOL PLAN: Inquire about this plan at your nearest BRASAS unit.

PARENTS’ MEETINGS: Check dates and times at your unit. Your presence is requested.

ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES: Same as for the Regular Course.

SENIORS
The SENIORS course has the same objectives as the regular course but is more flexible in terms of duration and assessment, catering to the needs of our students. Classes are twice a week, 85 minutes each.

AGE: Recommended for students over 60.

COURSE DURATION: Semester levels, at the end of which each student is individually assessed, considering their classroom participation.

CERTIFICATES: At the end of the course, students receive an official completion statement.

● Treat everyone with respect: At BRASAS Online, you will meet teachers and 
students from around the world, with different religions, cultures, and values. Please 
treat everyone with kindness, respect, and consideration for differences. We have a 
zero-tolerance policy for discrimination based on race, culture, religion, physical 
appearance, or sexual orientation. 
● Dress appropriately: Our dress code is similar to any in-person school or college. 
Casual clothing is fine, but students must be fully dressed. 
● Participate from a quiet place: Whenever possible, attend BRASAS Online classes 
in a quiet environment without excessive noise or interruptions. Your login and 
password are personal and non-transferable. BRASAS Online is exclusively for you. 
● Religion, politics, and controversial topics: Some teacher–student relationships 
may be open enough for discussions on religion, politics, or other sensitive topics. 
However, if the conversation becomes negative or offensive, please change the 
subject. 
● Always ask permission before sharing recordings or videos: You may review the 
recording of your class, which will be available from your teacher until the end of the 
week. Homework and other assignments will be posted in your Google Classroom. 
You may also share your experience on social media, but only after receiving 
permission from your teacher and/or classmates who appear in the video. 
Unauthorized sharing may result in a request to remove the video. 
● No alcoholic beverages during classes: Consuming alcohol during classes is 
prohibited. Since BRASAS Online is a learning environment, please also avoid 
smoking, eating, or chewing gum. 
● Do not share external contacts: For your privacy and security, BRASAS Online 
asks that you do not share external contact details (Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, 
Instagram, WeChat, etc.). Use Google Meet and Google Classroom for safe 
communication. 
● Do not offer or accept external services: BRASAS Online is a dedicated 
environment for learning Portuguese. To keep it safe and professional, do not 
promote or accept external services. Payments, gifts, or tips must not be offered or 
requested. 
● Cameras on : During online classes, students are required to keep their cameras on 
so that the teacher can observe how they articulate words. Having cameras on also 
fosters better interaction, increases focus, and helps create a more engaging 
learning environment. 
BRASAS AUDIO TRACKS 
The audio tracks are an integral part of our method, which enables: 
● Individualized learning. 
● Development of comprehension, training students to understand different voices, 
accents, and regional variations. 
● Improvement of pronunciation and intonation through individual repetition, at 
increasing speeds, with natural contractions and omissions typical of spoken 
Portuguese. 
● Repetition of selected passages as often as necessary. 
The audios were recorded by native Brazilian Portuguese speakers, incorporating the 
natural rhythm of the language and reflecting everyday situations. 
It is recommended to listen to the audios as often as possible to increase students’ fluency 
and confidence. Audios can be accessed within the digital books. 
Listen and repeat each audio orally at least three times. 
BRASAS DUTIES 
● Evaluate new students and place them in the appropriate level. 
● Start and end classes on time. 
● Hire fluent, competent, and well-prepared teachers. 
● Teach exclusively in Portuguese and encourage the use of Portuguese inside and 
outside the classroom. 
● Uniformly apply the BRASAS methodology. 
● Monitor each student’s progress individually and reclassify when necessary. 
● Prevent behaviors that may disturb the class. 
MINIMUM TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS 
To participate in classes, students must have: 
● A broadband connection with at least 1Mb/s download and upload speed, or a stable 
4G connection. 
● Equipment with camera, microphone, and speakers. 
● A compatible data plan to support online activities. 
Note: BRASAS is not responsible for technical problems such as internet instability or 
malfunction of the student’s equipment. 
CLASS RECORDINGS BY BRASAS 
Students expressly acknowledge that classes may be recorded by BRASAS, consenting in 
advance to the capture of their image and voice. Recordings are strictly for pedagogical 
purposes, allowing students to review classes until the end of the current module. 
OPENING AND RELOCATION OF CLASSES 
New classes may open at any time of the year when enrollment reaches the minimum 
required for didactic and economic viability. 
● The minimum is 5 paying students per class. As long as this number is maintained, 
BRASAS will keep the class at its original time. If the number falls below 5, students 
may be relocated to other classes, if available. 
The obligation to continue classes is reciprocal. 
○ 12 consecutive monthly installments per year, including holidays, vacations, 
and breaks.” 
ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES 
● Tuition: Each student pays 12 consecutive monthly installments per year, including 
holidays, vacations, and breaks. Payment is due regardless of attendance. Charges 
are made by recurring credit card on the same day as the first payment. Enrollment 
renewal is automatic. To discontinue, the student must notify BRASAS via official 
service channels before the next scheduled payment (email: online@brasas.com). 
● Payments: Tuition is paid exclusively by credit card in a subscription model. The 
monthly charge occurs automatically and does not affect the total card limit, only the 
monthly limit. Subscription options: monthly (no discount), semi-annual (8% 
discount), or annual (12% discount), according to the current price table. 
● Semi-annual or Annual Plans: 
○ Semi-annual: Six consecutive monthly installments (including holidays, 
vacations, and breaks), with an 8% discount. 
○ Annual: Twelve consecutive monthly installments (including holidays, 
vacations, and breaks), with a 12% discount. 
● Important: Cancellation or transfer requests for classes or modalities may be subject 
to a contractual fee. Please review the loyalty clause in the Terms and Conditions 
before subscribing. 
● Cancellations: BRASAS may suspend or cancel enrollment for non-payment, 
preventing access to online classes until the overdue balance and applicable charges 
are settled. 
● Refunds: Payments are refundable only if BRASAS is unable to start the class for 
internal reasons and the student does not wish to transfer to another schedule. 
● Vacations: Individual student vacations will result in reallocation to another class; 
however, continuity at the same lesson stage and the same schedule cannot be 
guaranteed. 
● Course interruptions: Students must request cancellation before the next 
scheduled payment by emailing online@brasas.com and filling out the official 
cancellation form. Outstanding debts must be settled. Students returning after less 
than three months must pay tuition for the period missed. Absence longer than three 
months requires a new placement test. 
Example: a student who cancels in November and returns in February must pay 
tuition for December and January. 
● Holidays: BRASAS observes national holidays in Brazil. Classes continue as normal 
on local holidays. 
CERTIFICATE AND COMMUNICATION 
Students authorize the electronic sending of promotional, academic, and financial materials, 
as well as other notices necessary for communication between the parties. 
COURSE DURATION 
● Placement: Students undergo a free evaluation test. Beginners, however, are not 
required to take the placement test. After placement, the frequency of studies is 
chosen, and tuition varies accordingly. 
● Duration: The Basic level includes 40 lessons, and the Intermediate level includes 
45 lessons. The pace of the course depends on the group’s progress, as lessons 
may be extended until the teacher feels the content has been mastered. The total 
duration of the course will vary according to the students’ progress. 
● Price adjustment: Prices are subject to adjustment due to teacher wage 
agreements and operational costs. 
● Vacations: BRASAS Online teachers have 23 collective vacation days (between 
December and January) and 7 days in the last week of July.`,
